  This watershed prioritization project, led by a researcher at Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), aims to identify priority watersheds across Canada for four freshwater fish conservation goals: area-based protection, habitat restoration, species at risk management, and invasive species management. Using national spatial data on fish diversity, stressors, and community change, priority areas were mapped based on expert-defined criteria. inSileco contributed by updating the analysis, developing an R package to ensure full reproducibility, and enhancing the existing Shiny app to allow users to generate custom maps that guide conservation efforts.
