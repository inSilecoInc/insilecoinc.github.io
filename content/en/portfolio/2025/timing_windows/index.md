description: | 
  The Timing Windows Project delivers a science-based, nationally scalable tool to inform the protection of freshwater fish species in Canada. Anchored by the National Timing Windows Database (NTWD) and an interactive Shiny web application—the Timing Windows Calculator—the project enables users to identify optimal timing windows to reduce ecological risks from water use activities (WUAs) such as dredging, dam operation, or shoreline construction. The tool integrates species-specific life stage data (spawning, migration, juvenile development) with environmental and phenological variables to assess risks across diverse regions and data availabilities. Through a structured five-step risk assessment framework, users can evaluate threats, explore timing windows, and generate recommendations. This flexible platform supports informed decision-making for environmental managers, regulators, and researchers seeking to align conservation measures with biological sensitivities.
