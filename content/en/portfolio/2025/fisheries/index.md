description: | 
  This project characterizes the intensity and distribution of commercial fishing in eastern Canada using 20 years of logbook data from Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Over 3 million fishing events were analyzed, encompassing 100 species and 57 gear types. Data were standardized, cleaned, and integrated into a suite of monthly, gear-specific raster layers representing fishing effort and landings across the region. By classifying gear types and linking species traits, we developed spatially explicit indicators of fishing pressure—including effort by gear, landings by target and bycatch species, and depth-specific activity. This high-resolution dataset reveals spatial and temporal trends in fishing pressure and supports cumulative impact assessments, fisheries management, and marine conservation planning.
