  The FMSS is a decision-support tool designed to explore the potential effects of management actions on fish populations, teach users key ecological principles, and help prescribe management solutions. In collaboration with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry of Ontario, we at inSileco integrated the core model—an age- and size-structured population under fishing pressure—into a Shiny App. The app allows users to select biological parameters and fishing scenarios, and compare performance metrics across different management strategies.
